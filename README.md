`derp`
======

Computers are great at doing stupid things.  Serve your sites at the speed of `derp`.




What are you on about this time
-------------------------------

Static site generators are the new hotness again this week; replace WordPress with (random script,) because what's a Movable Type, I guess.  And then they brag that their load time is "down to" ~360ms.

But, in the misappropriated words of D'Mite, we're gonna go bigger, and staticer.



And so what's `derp`?
---------------------

`derp` is a static site generator for [htstub](https://github.com/StoneCypher/htstub/).  Point it at a directory, and it will return the source to an Erlang module that will serve your site pre-compiled from memory.  

Think you're fast?

Wait until you're fast as derp.
